# Standard Desktop Configuration Editor

An unofficial USAF .Net integrated development environment.

- Configured to build projects using internal c-sharp compiler installed by default on all machines within the enterprise.

- Utilization does not constitute a breach of unauthorized software use policy, since the utility was developed using tools already available on the network.

- Runs on any workstation with Java installed.
